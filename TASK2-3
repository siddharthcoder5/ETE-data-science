introduction and discription of ENN-TO-END DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 
End-to-End Data Science Project Description
This Python program demonstrates an end-to-end data science project workflow. It includes the following steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

A simple dataset simulating a purchase decision based on age and salary is created.
Features (age and salary) and target (purchased) are defined.
Data is split into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.
The model is evaluated on a test set, and its accuracy is displayed.
The trained model is saved to a file (model.pkl) for later use.
API Development:

A Flask application is built to serve the model.
A single endpoint (/predict) accepts age and salary via a POST request, performs validation, and returns a prediction.
Model Deployment:

The Flask app runs locally, allowing users to interact with the model via HTTP requests.
Python Tools Used
Pandas:

For handling and preprocessing tabular data.
Scikit-learn:

To split data into training and testing sets.
For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
Pickle:

For saving and loading the trained model.
Flask:

To create and deploy an API for serving the model.
JSON:

For input and output data exchange in the API.
How to Use
Run the script to train and save the model.
Start the Flask server (app.run()).
Use an HTTP client (like Postman or curl) to send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict with JSON input:
json
Receive the prediction as a JSON response.
